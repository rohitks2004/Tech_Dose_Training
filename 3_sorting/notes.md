## note
1) inplace and outplace sorting techniques
    - inplace
        1) selection sort - stable
        2) bubble sort  - stable
        3) insertion sort - stable
    - outplace
        1) Merge sort - unstable
        2) quick sort - unstable
        3) counting sort
2) stable and unstable 
    - Stable
        - maintain the relative order of equal elements
    - Unstable
        - do not maintain the relative order of equal elements
