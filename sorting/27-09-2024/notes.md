## note
1) inplace and outplace sorting techniques
    - inplace
        1) selection sort - stable
        2) bubble sort  -  
        3) insertion sort
    - outplace
        1) Merge sort - unstable
        2) quick sort - unstable
2) stable and unstable 
    - Stable
        - maintain the relative order of equal elements
    - Unstable
        - do not maintain the relative order of equal elements

## problems
1) merge two sorted list
2) merge_sort iterative implementation

Home work of Yesterday's session 25/09/2024
-[ ] Code the iterative version of merge sort.
